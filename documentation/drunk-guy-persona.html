        <h2>Attitudes and Behaviors</h2>
            <p>Absolutely slammed with homework and frat parties, doesn't want to spend time arguing over trivial things like where to eat. Likes to find the latest and greatest apps for everything, especially apps that help make decisions as a group.</p>
        <h2>Frustrations and Needs</h2>
            <p>Theo needs some simple automation in his life without removing choice. He doesn't care where he and his friends decide to eat, only that he wants takeout and he wants it fast.</p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>When he's drunk at 2:30 am and trying to order food, anything that will eliminate an argument and save time is exactly what he and his frat needs. A quick meal will settle his bubble guts and reduce the severity of any possible hangover.</p>
