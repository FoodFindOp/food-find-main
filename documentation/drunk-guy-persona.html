    <h1>Drunk User Persona</h1>
        <h2>Name</h2>
            <p>Theodore Mckinnely III</p>
        <h2>Age</h2>
            <p>21</p>
        <h2>Profession</h2>
            <p>Full time student pursuing masters in computer science. In a fraternity at ASU in his junior year.</p>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>Linux power user. Has a Dell Alienware Aurora R12 with Kali Linux OS and two 14 inch monitors. Also has an apple iphone 13 pro max with iOS. Uses google chrome for everything. </p>
        <h2>Attitudes and Behaviors</h2>
            <p>Absolutely slammed with homework and frat parties, doesn't want to spend time arguing over trivial things like where to eat. Likes to find the latest and greatest apps for everything, especially apps that help make decisions as a group.</p>
        <h2>Frustrations and Needs</h2>
            <p>Theo needs some simple automation in his life without removing choice. He doesn't care where he and his friends decide to eat, only that he wants takeout and he wants it fast.</p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>When he's drunk at 2:30 am and trying to order food, anything that will eliminate an argument and save time is exactly what he and his frat needs. A quick meal will settle his bubble guts and reduce the severity of any possible hangover.</p>
        <h2>User Story</h2>
            <p>As a drunk user, me and the boys need to get a late night fourth meal without spending time arguing.</p>

    <h1>Use-Case and Interaction Flow</h1>
        <h2>Use-Case</h2>
            <p>User SpaghettiYeti and his buddies need food at 3 am. They can never decide where to eat diplomatically, so they found a simple app that will help them decide quickly.</p>
        <h2>Interaction Flow</h2>
            <h3>Precondition</h3>
                <p>User opens the Restaurant Tinder app.</p>
            <h3>Post-condition</h3>
                <p>The winning restaurant has been chosen.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>RT opens to the home screen and provides 3 options of "create group", "join a group?", or "flying solo?"</li>
                <li>Admin User taps "join a group".</li>
                <li>RT brings up list of pre-made groups.</li>
                <li>User selects group called "THE BOYYZ".</li>
                <li>After everyone joins, RT asks admin user for area code.</li>
                <li>Admin user types in area code and hits next button.</li>
                <li>RT asks if Admin user wants delivery or dine-in.</li>
                <li>Admin user taps delivery button</li>
                <li>RT finds 9 restaurants in area that deliver and are open, and shows user the number and the first choice with an option of swipe right or left.</li>
                <li>User swipes through all the choices</li>
                <li>RT says "tallying votes..." while others are still voting.</li>
                <li>once all users have voted, RT shows 5 restaurants remain and begins new round of voting.</li>
                <li>User votes again</li>
                <li>RT says "tallying votes..."</li>
                <li>after votes are in, RT says there is a 3 way tie.</li>
                <li>after a few moments, a randomizer initiates and shows the group the winner.</li>

            </ul>
